- 👋 Hi, I’m @WilliamOpenshaw

- 👀 I’m interested in game development, improv, and sketch comedy.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create and publish a D&D real-time 3D combat game called PrismoRarity. 
        It is being built upon the Fantom crypto network game, Rarity, by Andre Cronje (https://github.com/andrecronje/rarity)
        
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on PrismoRarity, and other projects related to Rarity, such as: 
        Rarity Open Mic (https://github.com/andrecronje/rarity/issues/87)
        
- 📫 How to reach me ...
